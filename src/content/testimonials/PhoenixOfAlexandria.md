excerpt:  Working with Jon was a pleasure! We are a small business, so an online presence is a must. Before we switched, we were using a web builder whose services did not justify it's cost. Working with Jon, we were able to work within our means, while having access to tools we absolutely need to grow our business like POS and QR Code. If you are looking for a <strong>quality website that is tailored to what you need</strong>, I would recommend working with Jon.

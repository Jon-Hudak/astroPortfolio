excerpt: Jon came along and turned a broken dream into reality... I highly recommend Jon to get the job done. <strong>No dreams are left broken!</strong>

<p>Working with Jon was an absolute pleasure. I had a half built website that was out of my expertise to fix, thus headed to the dumpster. I had a vision on how I wanted my website with store integration to not only look, but operate and he exceeded my expectations.  Jon came along and turned a broken dream into reality. Seeing my new site for the first time gave me an overwhelming sense of happiness and hopefulness - something I didn’t feel for it before. He was always eager to listen to my thoughts and ideas, be patient if a spur of the moment idea occurred and helped me walk through it.</p>

<p>Jon would even go the extra mile to be supportive and excited to get everything in motion. If I had questions through this process, they were always swiftly answered and explained. If things weren’t working properly - in a timely manner, he always worked through them and took the necessary troubleshooting steps to correct the issues to avoid future complications. While Jon has the technical skills, he also has an artistic eye to ensure the look and feel of my website was not only unique to my style but also user friendly, neat and consistent. I was able to launch my website and store on schedule with minimal complications - which were solved in real time and caused no disruption. I highly recommend Jon to get the job done! No dreams are left broken.</p>

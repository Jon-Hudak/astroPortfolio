            <p>
                Hi, I'm Jon, a local web developer from the Pittsburgh area. I'm
                passionate about building beautiful and functional websites that
                provide great user experiences. My expertise lies in building
                custom, static websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While I am
                familiar and can work with tools like Wordpress and Wix, I donâ€™t
                find them as engaging and fun to work with.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love the creativity and problem-solving aspects of web
                development, and I'm excited about the constantly evolving
                nature of this field. I approach each project with a fresh
                perspective and a commitment to delivering the best possible
                outcome, even if I have to stay up all night to achieve it!
            </p>

            <p>
                In my spare time, you can likely find me performing karaoke,
                playing board games (including DnD!), and even experimenting
                with new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the
                latest trends in web development. In my opinion, the most
                important skill a developer, or any programmer, can have is
                curiosity and, a willingness to perpetually learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're looking for a web developer who is passionate,
                dedicated, and committed to excellence, I'd love to hear about
                your project and see how I can help. Feel free to get in touch!
            </p>
